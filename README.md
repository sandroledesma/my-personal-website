# My Personal Website


With over a decade of experience in Product Management in various industries, I've recognized a gap in my experience specifically in the realm of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) within Smart Home Connectivity. While managing the life-cycle of Washers/Dryers at LG Electronics, I was exposed to these technologies although recognized that it is not used to its fullest potential.

I am eager to deepen my knowledge and bring the synergy of IoT and AI into products that are consistently reliable and universally beneficial, transcending generational barriers. I have dedicated much of my time learning about innovations of everyday products being reintroduced with interconnectivity.

Fundamentally, how will Smart Home evolve? My goal is to leverage all available resources to bolster my tech proficiency and acquired skills to advance my career as a Product Management Leader in Smart Home, while contributing to a technologically empowered future.
